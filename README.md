# Arch Consult

Premium AI-powered business consultancy platform. Next.js 14 (App Router) +
TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

Arch Consult is a real, founder-led, early-stage consultancy
(Blessed Otamekhoraye, Founder & Branding Consultant — Nigeria · Remote
worldwide). Because of that, this codebase deliberately avoids fabricated
stats, testimonials, clients, or case studies anywhere in the UI — see
"A note on honesty" below.

## Status: Stage 2 — Static content pages

Stage 1 delivered the foundation: scaffold, design system, navigation/footer,
homepage. Stage 2 adds the full static content pages: About, Services
(listing + 8 detail pages), Pricing, Contact (with a real working form and
API route), and Blog (listing + 6 full articles). It's built so later stages
(AI Consultant, Business Health Check, Launch Wizard, client dashboard,
admin dashboard, booking, Flutterwave payments) plug in without reworking
this layer.

### A note on honesty (read this)

Arch Consult is early-stage. Per explicit instruction, this build never
fabricates:
- Client counts, ratings, or "businesses advised" style stats
- Testimonials — `lib/constants.ts` has an intentionally empty
  `testimonials` array; `components/home/Testimonials.tsx` renders an honest
  "coming soon" state until real ones are added
- Case studies or named clients — there is no case-studies section
- Certifications, awards, or credentials for the founder
- Final pricing — every price in `pricingPackages` is explicitly labeled
  "Placeholder" in the UI, not a real number

When adding real content later, only the following need editing:
`lib/constants.ts` (`testimonials`, `pricingPackages` prices, `founder` bio)
— no component logic needs to change.

**Important — read this before running anything:** this codebase was written
in an offline sandbox with no access to the npm registry, so the
dependencies listed in `package.json` have not actually been installed or
build-tested by the tool that wrote them. The code follows standard,
current Next.js/Tailwind/TypeScript conventions throughout, but you must run
the install and build yourself (see below) and report back any error output
so it can be fixed — don't assume it's flawless untested code.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in real values as later stages need them
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run build   # production build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## What's implemented

- Design system: color tokens, typography (Fraunces display / IBM Plex Sans
  body), spacing and motion conventions — see `tailwind.config.ts` and
  `app/globals.css`.
- Real Arch Consult logo mark, extracted from your uploaded artwork with the
  background removed, in both light-surface and dark-surface variants
  (`public/logo-icon-dark.png`, `public/logo-icon-light.png`), plus a
  generated favicon/app icon set (`app/icon.png`, `app/apple-icon.png`).
- Global navigation (`components/layout/Navbar.tsx`) — responsive, with a
  working mobile menu (no library, plain React state).
- Global footer (`components/layout/Footer.tsx`).
- Full homepage (`app/page.tsx`) — hero, services overview, how it works,
  why Arch Consult, Business Health Check CTA, AI Consultant CTA,
  testimonials (honest empty state), founder section, insights preview,
  final CTA.
- **About** (`/about`) — mission, four-pillar approach, founder profile.
- **Services** (`/services` + `/services/[slug]`) — all 8 services with
  what-it-is / who-it's-for / problems-it-solves / deliverables, statically
  generated per service.
- **Pricing** (`/pricing`) — Starter / Growth / Strategic / Custom Enterprise,
  every price explicitly marked as a placeholder in the UI itself.
- **Contact** (`/contact`) — a real client-side form posting to a real
  server-side API route (`app/api/contact/route.ts`) with validation,
  sanitization, and basic in-memory rate limiting. If `RESEND_API_KEY` is
  set, it sends a real email via Resend; if not, it logs the submission
  server-side and tells the user honestly that email delivery isn't
  configured yet — it never fakes a "sent" confirmation.
- **Blog** (`/blog` + `/blog/[slug]`) — 6 full placeholder articles across
  the categories from the brief (Branding, Business Strategy, Marketing,
  Entrepreneurship, AI, African Business), statically generated per post.
- Base SEO: metadata, Open Graph tags, `sitemap.ts` (now includes every
  service and blog route), `robots.ts`.
- Accessibility floor: visible focus rings, `prefers-reduced-motion`
  respected, semantic landmarks, real form labels.

## What's intentionally not built yet

Every link to `/ai-consultant`, `/health-check`, `/launch-wizard`,
`/book-consultation`, `/login` currently points to a route that doesn't
exist yet — that's expected at this stage, not a bug. They'll 404 until
built in the next stages, in this order:

1. Auth: register/login/reset, session handling
2. AI Consultant (OpenAI, server-side only)
3. Business Health Check + Business Launch Wizard
4. AI Tools suite
5. Booking system
6. Client dashboard (projects, reports, bookings, payments, documents,
   messages)
7. Admin dashboard (including making `pricingPackages` admin-editable
   instead of hard-coded)
8. Flutterwave payment integration (server-side verified)
9. Database wiring (Postgres/Supabase) replacing in-file demo data
10. Final QA pass: full route check, mobile pass, error/loading/empty
    states, accessibility pass

## Environment variables

See `.env.example`. Nothing in this stage requires real secrets yet — the
file exists now so the shape of configuration is stable as later stages
start consuming it. Never commit `.env.local`.
